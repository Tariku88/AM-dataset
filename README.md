# AM-dataset
In this repository, we have provided the AM dataset that is derived from Digimat-AM.  We also provided Digimat-AM models of all corresponding configurations. Various configurations of the Digimat-AM models are uploaded in (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tariku-Tamir/research). This AM data is utilized for the work of our paper entitled “Data-driven and physics-assisted machine learning approach for warpage classification and process parameter optimization in a 3D-printed BeltClip”. The data collection of the paper begins with obtaining the STereoLithography (STL) file of the BeltClip object from Thingiverse and slicing it in Ultimaker© Cura, considering process parameters such as infill amount, toolpath pattern, layer height, print speed, and extrusion temperature (can be accessed through the Gcode files folder). The resulting G-code file is then input into Digimat-AM for further parameter setting and analysis. In Digimat-AM, glass fiber-filled and unfilled material types are set, undergoing the virtual 3D printing process (can be accessed through the Digimat model files folder), followed by a warpage analysis of the printed BeltClip. The collected 3D printing data is used to build ML models—deep neural network (DNN), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and random forest.
